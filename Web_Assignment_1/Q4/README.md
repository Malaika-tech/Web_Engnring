I implemented this Banking System using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, allowing users to create an account with a roll number, generating a unique account number and initial balance. Users can deposit amounts (restricted to multiples of their roll number), withdraw up to 80% of their balance, and view an updated transaction history. The system maintains a real-time log of deposits and withdrawals and provides an option to download the transaction history as a .txt file. It features error handling for invalid transactions and updates the balance dynamically. Future enhancements could include persistent storage, improved UI/UX, and user authentication for a more robust experience.
