I developed a Product showcase web page featuring a dark mode toggle, implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The page dynamically displays products with a flip card effect, and the dark mode toggle is positioned at the bottom right of the footer for accessibility. The theme preference is stored using localStorage to maintain user settings. The design ensures a smooth transition between light and dark modes while keeping the layout responsive and visually accesible.
