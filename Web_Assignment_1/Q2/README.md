I implemented this task manager web application to help users efficiently manage their tasks with priority levels(high, medium, and low). The app allows users to add, search, complete, and delete tasks while keeping track of remaining tasks. I designed a clean and responsive UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a smooth user experience. Additiotnally, I integrated a dark mode toggle for better accessibility and visual comfort. Tasks are color coded based on priority, making it easy to organize and filter them. This project is lightweight, interactive, and ideal for personal task management.
