I developed this web-based tool to reverse a user-inputted string while preserving every **N-th** character in its original position, where **N** is calculated by summing the digits of the provided roll number. Using JavaScriptâ€™s filter(), map(), and reduce() functions, the tool extracts digits, computes the skip interval, and processes the string accordingly. The transformed result is displayed dynamically with DOM manipulation, ensuring correct placement of spaces and special characters. Edge cases like (N > string length) are handled, and users can manually enter a skip interval as an alternative. Built with **Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, this project demonstrates efficient use of arrow functions, map(), sets, and event handling for a seamless user experience.
