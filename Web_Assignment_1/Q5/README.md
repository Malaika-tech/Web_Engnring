I developed this simple project **Product Purchase Calculator** that allows users to select products, enter a roll number, apply promo codes, and calculate the final price after applying discounts. It validates roll numbers, calculates discounts based on roll numbers (up to 60%), and applies additional promo code discounts (`students: 10%`, `extras: 5%`). The cart dynamically updates when products are selected, ensuring a seamless user experience.
